# Process Flow Diagrams

Process flow diagrams (PFDs) are visual representations of the steps involved in a business process.

**Example:**
1. Customer places an order.
2. System processes the order.
3. Inventory is updated.
4. Order is shipped to the customer.

Use tools like Lucidchart, Visio, or Draw.io to create diagrams.
